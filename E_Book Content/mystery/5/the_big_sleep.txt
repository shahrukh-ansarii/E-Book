The Big Sleep is a 1946 film noir directed by Howard Hawks,[2][3] the first film version of the 1939 novel of the same name by Raymond Chandler. The film stars Humphrey Bogart as private detective Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as Vivian Rutledge in a story about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results".[4] William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay. In 1997, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant," and added it to the National Film Registry.[5][6]

Parts of the unreleased 1945 cut were significantly re-scripted and shot to take advantage of the public's fascination with "Bogie and Bacall". The original 1945 version was restored and released in 1997.
